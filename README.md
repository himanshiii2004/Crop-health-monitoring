Today, I developed a machine learning project using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to assist Indian farmers in crop selection. The project utilizes a database comprising approximately 2200 entries, each containing essential agricultural data. This dataset enables us to predict the optimal crop for farmers based on their specific field conditions.

Our model supports predictions for 22 different types of crops, offering tailored recommendations that align with local environmental factors. By implementing this project, we aim to empower farmers, both experienced and new, in making informed decisions about crop cultivation.

This initiative has the potential to significantly enhance agricultural productivity by enabling farmers to select crops best suited to their land and climate conditions. Future developments could include expanding the dataset, refining model parameters, and exploring user-friendly deployment options to maximize accessibility and usability for farmers.
